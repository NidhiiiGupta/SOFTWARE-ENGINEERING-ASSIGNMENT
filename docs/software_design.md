# Software Design Documentation  

## üìå Project Overview  
This document outlines the software architecture for a **Linux-based automation system** that monitors system logs for critical errors and sends alerts to administrators. The design follows core software engineering principles such as **abstraction, modularity, cohesion, and low coupling** to ensure efficiency and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Software Design Principles  

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction  
- The system offers **high-level functionality** for log monitoring and alerting, shielding users from internal complexities.  
- Users interact with a **single script interface**, while background processes manage log scanning and notifications.  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation  
- Log scanning, error filtering, and notification tasks are structured into **distinct functions**, restricting direct access to internal operations.  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Modularity  
- The system is structured into **independent, reusable modules**:  
  - **Log Scanner:** Retrieves error logs from system files.  
  - **Alert System:** Notifies administrators about critical errors.  
  - **Error Logging:** Records detected errors for future reference.  
- Each module functions independently, enhancing **maintainability and scalability**.  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cohesion & Coupling  
- **High Cohesion:** Each module is designed to perform a **single, well-defined task**.  
- **Low Coupling:** Modules communicate through **structured function calls**, reducing dependencies.
